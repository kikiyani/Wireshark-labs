# Wireshark-projects-labs

This repository contains all of my Wireshark-based projects and lab exercises completed through **Coursera cybersecurity courses** and related guided projects.  
The goal is to document my practical learning, showcase applied packet analysis skills, and provide a reference for future study or demonstrations.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Wireshark is a powerful open-source network protocol analyzer used in cybersecurity, digital forensics, and network troubleshooting.  
This repo organizes my work into clear sections, including packet captures, analysis reports, and step-by-step walkthroughs of different labs.
